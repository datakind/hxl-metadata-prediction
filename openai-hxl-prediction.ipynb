        "A data standard on platforms such as the [Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](https://data.humdata.org/) is the [Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL)](https://hxlstandard.org/), a column level set of attributes and tags and attributes which improve data interoperability and discovery. These tags and attributes are typically set by hand by data owners, which being a manual process can result in poor dataset coverage. Improving coverage through ML and AI techniques is desirable for faster and more efficient use of data in responding to Humanitarian disasters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Previous work has focussed on fine tuning LLMs to complete tags and attrubutes, starting with the study [Predicting Metadata on Humanitarian Datasets with GPT 3](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/predicting-metadata-for-humanitarian-datasets-using-gpt-3-b104be17716d). This has yielded promosing results, but is constrained by the quality of training data and the HDX team have confirmed that basic tags related to location and dates are popular, more esoteric tags defined in [the standard](https://hxlstandard.org/standard/1-1final/tagging/) are not well represented.\n",

        "This notebook fine-tunes an OpenAI model to test performance.\n",
