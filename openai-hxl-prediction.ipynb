        "Fine-tuning an LLM to predict HXL tags is low-cost, but it constrained by the training data. Many datasets tagged with HXL has used tags and attributes which are not part of the HXL standard, and though there is good representation of tags and attributes related to location and dates, which are indeed very useful, beyond this coverage is poor. These challenges in the training data limit the scenarios in which the LLM fine-tuning technique can be applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in recent months there have been significant advances in LLMs, for example with the release of GPT-4o. Using this model, prompted with the full HXL standard definitions, it was shown that performance is better than fine-tuning and in some cases better than the humans who tagged the training data.\n",
